The `lms` CLI is open source on GitHub: https://github.com/lmstudio-ai/lms

If you spot a bug, want to request a feature, or plan to contribute:

- File issues or feature requests in the GitHub repository.
- Open pull requests against the `main` branch with a concise summary and testing notes.
- Review the repository README for setup instructions and coding standards.
