### Enable Developer Mode

Developer Mode combines the previous Developer and Power User modes into a single mode with all advanced features enabled. You can enable Developer mode in Settings > Developer.

### Which mode should I choose?

#### `User`

Show only the chat interface, and auto-configure everything. This is the best choice for beginners or anyone who's happy with the default settings.


#### `Developer`

Full access to all aspects in LM Studio. This includes keyboard shortcuts and development features. 

Use LM Studio in this mode if you want access to configurable [load](/docs/configuration/load) and [inference](/docs/configuration/inference) parameters as well as advanced chat features such as [insert, edit, &amp; continue](/docs/advanced/context) (for either role, user or assistant).
